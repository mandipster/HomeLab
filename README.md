# Project Documentation: Active Directory Home Lab

## Introduction
The Active Directory, Splunk, and Kali Linux Home Lab project aims to provide an immersive learning experience in system administration, log management, and ethical hacking. This documentation serves as a guide to set up a comprehensive home lab environment for hands-on exploration.

## Objectives
- Establish a virtualized environment using VirtualBox.
- Configure VMs including Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server 2022, and Ubuntu Server with Splunk.
- Install and configure Sysmon and Splunk for enhanced logging and monitoring.
- Set up Windows Active Directory, promote a Windows Server to a domain controller, and join client machines to the domain.
- Explore domain functionalities, user management, and group policies within the Active Directory environment.
- Utilize Splunk for log analysis and security event monitoring.
- Conduct ethical hacking exercises and penetration testing using Kali Linux (Only brute force).

## Setup
- **Virtualization Platform:** VirtualBox
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
  - Windows 10
  - Kali Linux
  - Windows Server 2022
  - Ubuntu Server with Splunk
- **Logical Diagram:** Created using Draw.io for visualization of the architecture.

## Installation and Configuration
- Installed and configured VMs with appropriate operating systems and software.
- Configured network settings for communication between VMs and external networks.
- Set up Sysmon and Splunk for logging and monitoring on Windows instances.
- Integrated Atomic Red Team framework into the lab environment to initiate controlled security testing. 

## Active Directory Configuration
- Deployed and configured Windows Server 2022 as the primary domain controller.
- Managed Active Directory users, groups, and OUs.
- Joined Windows 10 client machines to the Active Directory domain.

## Exploration and Learning
- Explored various aspects of Active Directory, including user authentication and group policies.
- Leveraged Splunk for log analysis and security event monitoring.
- Conducted brute force attack on target machine using Kali Linux.

## Conclusion
The Active Directory, Splunk, and Kali Linux Home Lab project offers valuable insights and practical skills in system administration, log management, and ethical hacking. By creating a realistic environment and documenting the process comprehensively, participants gain proficiency applicable to real-world IT scenarios and security practices.

## Future Considerations
- Running more Atomic tests to gain insights on MITRE and ATT&CK.
- Continuously update and expand the home lab environment.
- Collaborate with peers and contribute to the cybersecurity community.
